## 🎯 Overview
**LandSeek: Admin Access** is the administrator system that complements the main [LandSeek User System](https://github.com/migslahorra/landseek).  

While the **user system** provides a digital marketplace for buying and selling land, the **admin system** gives administrators the tools to:  
- Manage user accounts,  
- Oversee property listings,  
- Process reports and complaints,  
- Restrict or ban accounts when necessary.  

This separation ensures the marketplace remains fair, secure, and properly moderated.
